<h1>Harry Potter</h1>

For this project, the plan was to use torch-rnn to learn from some Harry Potter texts and attempt to write something which is understandable.

<ul>
  {% for post in site.harrypotter %}
    <li>
      <h2><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
      {{ post.excerpt }}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
