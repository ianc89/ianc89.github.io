<h1>Scifi Corpus</h1>

For this project, the plan was to use torch-rnn to learn from the <a href="https://archive.org/details/scifi-corpus">scifi corpus</a> and see what can be generated. This is a very large dataset.

<ul>
  {% for post in site.categories.scifi %}
    <li>
      <h2><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
      {{ post.excerpt }}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
